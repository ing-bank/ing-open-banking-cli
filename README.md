# ING Open Banking CLI

The ING Open Banking Command Line Interface (CLI) is implemented with scripts. These scripts can be used to
test your connection to the ING sandbox for Open Banking APIs (Premium and PSD2). It is your starting point to
create wonderful apps using ING APIs!

## Test your connection to ING:

* Call OAuth API to get a token
* Call Open Banking API with the token

## Choose your test environment:

* [Bash](/scripts/bash/README.md) Readme
* [Node.js](/scripts/javascript/README.md) Readme

## Software Development Kit (SDK)

We are also providing an SDK for frictionless calls to Open Banking APIs. The SDK provides drivers that can be used
directly in your applications to connect to ING. Find all the details [here](https://github.com/ing-bank/ing-open-banking-sdk).
